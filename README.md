Assignment for Intro to Software Development; Final Project
Running Calculator

This project varied in scope and scale as I learned my own limitations as well as the limitations of what i am capable of.
In the future i hope to revisit this code with some love.

When you download the ZIP file, you'll see three files in the folder. Breezypythongui, RunMe, images.
There is an additional file to download to test with a premade dataset for the loading functions, save.p.
It is optional because if you save once you have achieved much of the function.

1. Open the file RunMe.py
2. Fill out the fields:
  a. Distance, in Miles with the distance run, in miles.
  b. Time, in minutes with the time it took in minutes to complete the run
  c. Desired time with what your target is/was.
3. Click Record
4. The output shows all important information to be derived. If that all looks accurate, press save.
5. Next time you go running, fill it out again. It will remember the last run and tell you the differencial between them.
